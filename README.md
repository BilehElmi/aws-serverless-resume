# AWS Serverless Resume Website

This project demonstrates how to build and host a **serverless resume website** using AWS services such as **S3**, **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**. The website displays a dynamic visitor counter powered by AWS cloud-native solutions.

## **Features**
- Static resume website hosted on Amazon S3.
- Visitor counter implemented using:
  - **DynamoDB**: To store the visitor count.
  - **AWS Lambda**: To handle backend logic for incrementing and retrieving the count.
  - **API Gateway**: To expose the Lambda function via a RESTful API.
- Fully serverless architecture with no need for traditional servers.
- Responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Frontend**:
   - The resume is written in HTML and styled with CSS.
   - JavaScript fetches the visitor count from the API Gateway endpoint and dynamically displays it on the website.

2. **Backend**:
   - A DynamoDB table stores the visitor count with a simple schema (`id` and `visitCount`).
   - A Lambda function updates the visitor count in DynamoDB and returns the updated value.
   - API Gateway exposes the Lambda function to handle HTTP GET requests.

3. **Hosting**:
   - The static files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.) are hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
To replicate this project, youâ€™ll need:
- An AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services like S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

### Steps to Build This Project

#### 1. Create a Static Website on S3
- Create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.
- Upload your `index.html` and `styles.css` files to the bucket.
- Configure public access permissions for your bucket.

#### 2. Set Up DynamoDB
- Create a DynamoDB table named `VisitorCounter` with:
  - Partition Key: `id` (String).
  - Add an initial item: `{ "id": "visitor", "visitCount": 0 }`.

#### 3. Write the Lambda Function
- Create a Lambda function in Python or Node.js to:
  - Increment the visitor count in DynamoDB.
  - Return the updated count as a JSON response.

#### 4. Configure API Gateway
- Create an HTTP API in API Gateway.
- Link it to your Lambda function with a `/visitor` route.
- Enable CORS to allow requests from your S3-hosted website.

#### 5. Integrate Frontend with Backend
- Add JavaScript to fetch the visitor count from the API Gateway endpoint.
- Display the count dynamically on your webpage.

#### 6. Test Everything
- Test your website by visiting its URL and verify that:
  - The visitor counter increments correctly.
  - The page loads without errors.

## **Lessons Learned**
This project helped me:
1. Understand how to use AWS services together to build serverless applications.
2. Troubleshoot common issues like CORS errors and data serialization problems in Lambda functions.
3. Deploy a fully functional static website integrated with backend logic.
